For the implementation of the web app that we have created, you can try out our algorithm with a small web app that we have included in
these files.

In order to run our web app you have to run these commands

cd site //in order to move to the specific file
python app.py //in order to run the app.py file

Then open a browser in the default address (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) and play around with our awesome app
